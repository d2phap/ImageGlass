<h3>Project Decription</h3>
<p>ImageGlass is a simple picture viewer with which you will be able to display your image collection in a very similar way to the one that Windows provides by default, but with some additional functions. This application will allow you to better manage your pictures thanks to the options it includes and the extension it enables to install for adding more functions and widening its possibilities.</p>
<p>
With ImageGlass you will be able to drag and drop the image, zoom in and zoom out and perform several actions that are not available in some other similar software, such as uploading images to Facebook. For those users who want a simple and quick image viewer this would be a good option, since its PC requirements are very low. Besides, its performance is rather good and the functions it provides can be improved by several available extensions that make ImageGlass compatible with other non-native functions. This way, ImageGlass' users can change some functionalities of the main program; however, this option is actually not too expanded offering right now just a theme modifier. Similarly, some criticism has arisen due to the 'Rotate' option, because it affects all the images loaded in the interface.

<p>
Getting ImageGlass in your PC won't take you too long. Once you are done with the setup process, you will soon notice that ImageGlass provides the features that Windows' standard image viewer lacks. This program will display your pictures at the center of the screen after you open them with the traditional 'Open' dialog or just right after you drag and drop them over the interface.
</p><p>
The main options of ImageGlass are distributed in an horizontal toolbar located at the top of the screen. There you can choose to rotate images, zoom in or out, fit the image on the interface, etc. To switch between images you just need to use Back and Forward options. In case you want to jump to a certain file, you will need to provide its index number on a built-in window. Besides, this program is able to display the files you load as thumbnails.
</p><p>
But one of the most outstanding features of ImageGlass, along with the Facebook uploading possibility, is the chance of removing the background while viewing PNG and GIF photos. Moreover, format conversion in this program is quite easy. There is not a separate option for this; all you must do is saving the image in the format you desire to get in the standard 'Save' dialog
